    print("both operators are true.")

# 2 - as

# understand with Example:
import math as m 
print("square roots of 12 is", m.sqrt(16))

# 3 - break 
# used to exit a loop or a statement block.
# understand with Example:
for i in range(15):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# 4- class

ans= Mobile("Samsung")
print("my fav phone brand is",ans.name)

# 5 - continue
# used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
# understand with Example:
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        continue  # Skip printing when i equals 5.
    print(i)

# 6 - def

elif num < 20:
    print(f"{num} is less then 20")
else:
